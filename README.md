# 🎓 Intelligent Short Answer Grading Platform (ASAG)

An intelligent web-based platform for **automated short-answer assessment, feedback generation, and learning analytics** using NLP and a teacher-guided AI workflow (human-in-the-loop).

This project is developed as part of the Graduation Project module.

# 👥 Team

- **Shukrullo Baxtiyorov (220411)** — NLP model, dataset preparation, evaluation
- **Sanjar Raximjanov (220304)** — Backend, database, API, system integration
- **Akmaljon Polatjonov (220484)** — Frontend, analytics dashboards, usability testing

---

# 🎯 Project Goals

- Automatically score short-answer responses (rubric-based 0–5)
- Generate clear and useful feedback for students
- Allow teachers to review and correct AI outputs
- Store corrections to improve the model
- Provide learning analytics dashboards
- Reduce grading time and improve consistency

---

# 🏗️ Project Architecture

The system consists of 3 main services:

1. **Backend API (FastAPI)**
2. **NLP Service (AI scoring + feedback)**
3. **Frontend (React)**
4. **PostgreSQL Database**
5. **Dockerized infrastructure**
